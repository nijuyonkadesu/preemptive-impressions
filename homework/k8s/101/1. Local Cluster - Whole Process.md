## Cluster
We willuse minicube (vm) ( single node `[` [[Basic Structure#1. Control Plane|control plane]] + [[Basic Structure#2. Worker Node|worker node]] `]`)
`minikube start`
`minikube dashboard` - GUI to do all k8s stuffs

> Deployment is the recommended way to manage / scale pods
## Deployment
Create a deployment using [[Basic Structure#Kubectl|kubectl]] 

`kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.39 -- /agnhost netexec --http-port=8080`

`"/agnhost netexec --http-port=8080"` is a command for the container [init script]

`kubectl get deployments / pods / events / services` - current status
`kubectl config view` - get config file 
`kubectl logs <pod-name>` - get logs
## Need for Services
To expose pods outside of Kubernetes' private network for users to interact with. [Provides Endpoints]
Pods are auto managed by the **Deployment**. So fundamentally, you'll never know the names / IPs of the active Pods. 

**Scenario**: let's say, you have some frontend pods that needs to work with backend pods. But, how does your frontend pods know about available backend pods?
> Frontends needn't know or required to keep track of backends...
> **Services** enters the chat

Services allow decoupling of **Pods**, although, when one pod needs help of another. This is achieved using [**Labels**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#motivation).
```json
metadata: {
	labels: {
		'tier': 'backend'
	}
}
```
Service Discovery: [DNS, Environmental Variables] - All ports in *multiport* should share the same protocol [TCP] in multiport

### Create Service
`kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080`
`minikube service hello-node` - other providers gives you *External IP*, but minikube opens in browser
User Addons
```shell
minikube addons [enable / disable] metrics-server
```
## Ingress - HTTP(S) oversee
Traffic are routed based on the ingress rules. With [SSL, Load Balancing],  [Single Listener]

Need more advance capabilities?: [Gateway]
## Cleanup
```shell
kubectl delete service hello-node
kubectl delete deployment hello-node
minikube stop
```

[Cuttle doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)
## Recap
1. Start minicube cluster
2. use kubecuttle to create a deployment from an image
3. expose Deployment:  by [[#Create Service]] - it gives a external IP
4. configure addons
5. for https protocol, try [[#Ingress - HTTP(S) oversee]]
6. [[#Cleanup]]
