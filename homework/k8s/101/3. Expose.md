[[1. Local Cluster - Whole Process#Need for Services|Need for Services]]

A deployment is exposable, and it becomes a service.
A **Service** in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Allows application to receive traffic. 

- Service allows pods to die and replicate in k8s without impacting your application
- Discovery and routing among dependent Pods (such as the frontend and backend components in an application) are handled by k8s Services
- ***localhost*** is only available to containers in same pod. [Connect Applications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/connect-applications-service/)

Service types: [ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName (dns-cname)]
``` 
			^default
					 ^NAT
							 ^External IP
											^alias
```
> [!tip]+
> Not using selector allows to manually map a Service somewhere. Totally our wish. But nah don't do it.

1. **Create a Service**
Notice `deployment -> service`  
```bash
kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="NodePort" --port 8080
kubectl describe deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp

export NODE_PORT="$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')"
echo "NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT"

curl http://"$(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT"
app is exposed via port    ^
```

2. **Using Labels**
get `$POD_NAME` as usual and run 
`kubectl label pods "$POD_NAME" version=v1`
`kubectl get pods -l version=v1`
[Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/)

3. **Delete Service**
Our `deployment` is a `service`!
```bash
kubectl delete service -l app=kubernetes-bootcamp
kubectl get services

kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME -- curl http://localhost:8080
^ works

curl http://"$(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT"
^ no work
```
