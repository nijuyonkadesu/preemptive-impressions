`{ [Control plane -> xNodes], ... } <- a cluster`

CLI modes
1. imperative Interaction
2. declarative Interaction `[Manifests / yaml]`
### Controller & Node Structure
`{ [worker-node [runtime [pod [container]]]], ... } <- ðŸ‘€ by controller(loop)` - tries to keep the node state closer to the desired state 
### 1. Control Plane
contains `[API Server, etcd, controller manager, scheduler]`
etcd: all info about the server `[k-v pairs]`

Managing overall health of *a cluster*. 
- pod `[new / scale / expose / destroy / manage]`
### 2. Worker Node

[[#Controller & Node Structure]]
- kubectl - follows the order from scheduler. whines back to control plane if it can't do the job it was given with.
