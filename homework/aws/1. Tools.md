[Region [Availability zones [datacenters]]]
look for factors
btw, use spot instance if interruption of workload is not a big deal

1. cloud front - edge location **caching**
2. root user = the amazon login username, (use IAM account with admin permissions) use that to create other IAM accounts / group  with policies applied 
	1. Roles for application temporary access (s3, dynamodb access, ...)
	2. For long-term use and rotate IAM access keys regularly
	3. Create Organization Units with Service Control policy (overridable by IAM policy)
3. MFA
4. AMI - like docker (pre-configure, entire OS environment)
5. STOPPED is like hybernation stage (it can be resumed)
6. ECS, EKS + containers | fargate (serverless) + EKS + pods | triggers + lambda
7. SQS - queing service
8. Lamba - serverless - event triggered (with API call)
9. Fargate ^^^^ same for containers
10. Cloud Formation
11. AWS Direct (VPN / connect with onpremise setup)
12. Route 53 (for DNS)
13. Redshift (data warehousing)
14. Data Migration Service (anywhere -> target service)
15. OH CIDR `2^(32-xx) -1 (network ip) -1 (multicast ip) = total available ip addresses`
16. Shield (DDOS prevension)
17. KMS manage secret keys and perform encrypted data transfering
18. WAF Web Application Firewall
19. Inspector (Run security tests), GuardDudy (monitor network activities, logs)
20.  Sage maker for ML
21. [Use this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) to design and operate cost efficient structure in AWS
22. use aws policy generator

# Network: Configure VPC

1. Create EC2 > search VPC service > your vpcs > create new > IP: 10.**1.0**.0/16
2. Create 2 subnets on **availability zone**
	1. Private 10.**1.1**.0/24
	2. Public  10.**1.3**.0/24
3. Add a network gateway to VPC (it provides internet to VPC) (one-one relation)
4. Add a optional vpn gateway to access private resources directly for office HQ or smth
5. Provide ***routes*** to let gateway know to which vpc to route the traffic
	1. map internet gateway to subnet to provide public internet access
	2. route tables > create route table > give name 
	3. edit route > add route > 0.0.0.0/0 (v4) | ::/0 (v6) if no specific ip-map is found, this becomes the fallback destination for traffic > connect it to **igw** (gateway)
	4. Subnet Association > select public subnets > add associations
6. the *default route* only allows local traffic (within the vpc only)

## Subnet Security
1. ACLs
	1. Inbound & Outbound rules for protocols
	2. STATELESS
2. Securtity Groups
	1. Select protocols (outbounds are made automatically)
	2. STATEFULL

## Launch Instance With New VPC
go to instance > new > choose the newly made vpc > choose subnet > create security group > 

# Storage: Block & Object

![[Pasted image 20231130211221.png]]

1. EFS (standard & zone level storage options)
2. FSx (for HPC workload, file sharing & collab, media & entertainment, entrp. data storage)
3. One EBS to  one AZ (AZ can have >1 EBS attached) - Fixed Size
4. S3 (Region Specific, Object Store, Different Storage Classes)
	1. Create Bucket > give a DNS compliant unique name > make public and change ACL type if you desire
	2. Bucket policy
	3. Versioning to prevent object overwriting
	4. S3 + CloudFront edge location caching

Take backup volume snapshots

# Database
- Easy crate
- Multi AZ Deployment of RDS
- DynamoDB (noSQL), ledger, graph, wide column (cassendra), time series, in-mem cache (Redis), document. blockchain
Life Cycle Rules
![[Pasted image 20231117225719.png]]
## DynamoDB
- use IAM Roles + Policy

# Monitoring
- CloudWatch
- Cloud Trail - tracks API calls (any AWS ones)
- add widgets
- add alerts
- query metrics (event logs / log groups)
- Trust Advisor - suggests you best practices - real time

# Scaling

## Load balancer
1. Add load balancer [Application (https) LB, TCP/UDP LB, Gateway LB]
2. Create security group (inbound protocol rules)
3. Configure target group
4. get dns url of the loadbalancer

## Auto Scaling
1. Set up Auto Scaling
2. Create launch template
3. Create auto scaling group
4. Select pvt subnets
5. add load balancer
6. add target group
7. add tracking policy

ughhh.... could have started with EKS right away... after all this long, its just got mentioned 'it's possible to do without EC2'

# Best Practices
1. Hardening - reduce attack surface - CIS Benchmark
2. Encrypt EBS
3. Use patch manager to update OS
4. Follow container security practices
