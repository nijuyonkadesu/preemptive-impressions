[Region [Availability zones [datacenters]]]
look for factors

1. cloud front - edge location caching
2. root user = the amazon login username, (use IAM account with admin permissions) use that to create other IAM accounts / group  with policies applied 
	1. Roles for application access (s3, dynamodb access, ...)
3. MFA
4. AMI - like docker (pre-configure, entire OS environment)
5. STOPPED is like hybernation stage (it can be resumed)
6. EKS + containers | fargate (serverless) + EKS + pods | triggers + lambda
7. OH CIDR 2^(32-xx) -1 (network ip) -1 (multicast ip) = total available ip addresses

# Network: Configure VPC

1. Create EC2 > search VPC service > your vpcs > create new > IP: 10.**1.0**.0/16
2. Create 2 subnets on **availability zone**
	1. Private 10.**1.1**.0/24
	2. Public  10.**1.3**.0/24
3. Add a network gateway to VPC (it provides internet to VPC) (one-one relation)
4. Add a optional vpn gateway to access private resources directly for office HQ or smth
5. Provide ***routes*** to let gateway know to which vpc to route the traffic
	1. map internet gateway to subnet to provide public internet access
	2. route tables > create route table > give name 
	3. edit route > add route > 0.0.0.0/0 (v4) | ::/0 (v6) if no specific ip-map is found, this becomes the fallback destination for traffic > connect it to **igw** (gateway)
	4. Subnet Association > select public subnets > add associations
6. the *default route* only allows local traffic (within the vpc only)

## Subnet Security
1. ACLs
	1. Inbound & Outbound rules for protocols
	2. STATELESS
2. Securtity Groups
	1. Select protocols (outbounds are made automatically)
	2. STATEFULL

## Launch Instance With New VPC
go to instance > new > choose the newly made vpc > choose subnet > create security group > 

# Storage: Block & Object
1. EFS (standard & zone level storage options)
2. FSx (for HPC workload, file sharing & collab, media & entertainment, entrp. data storage)

3. One EBS to  one AZ (AZ can have >1 EBS attached) - Fixed Size
4. S3 (Region Specific, Object Store, Different Storage Classes)
	1. Create Bucket > give a DNS compliant unique name > make public and change ACL type if you desire
	2. Bucket policy
	3. Versioning to prevent object overwriting
	4. S3 + CloudFront edge location caching
