# Cost visibility
unblended cost (without any discounts / any other complex process involved)
- 4 tools for cost visibility and overspending prevention
	- billing, cost explorer, budget & anamoly detection

- get **reports** form cost explorers and feed em to athena / quicksight - external visualization tool
- set **alerts** & **threshold** on budget through (**SNS**)
- set budget **actions** (restrictions)

## Organization CFM practices
- see, save, plan, run - Cloud Financial Management
- tech x finance team (cost / budget changes) - just visit the [vid](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1955/play/34372/aws-foundations-cost-management;lp=904) when you really want to implement this (copy paste REA group's tactics)
- cost alloc with tags (with discounts)
- cost visibility (copy lyft)
- cost optimization:
	- use **spot instances** than on-demand instance
	- include before starting a project (in plan & design stage)
	- and automate everything
