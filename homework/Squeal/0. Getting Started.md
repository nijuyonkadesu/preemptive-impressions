# Basics of the basics

```plsql
# Logic
AND, OR, XOR, NOT

IN (, , , ,)
BETWEEN

LIMIT 1

# Matching
LIKE '%_ok__'
REGEXP 'pattern'
LEFT(str, length)
RIGHT(credit_card_number, 4)
TRIM(str)
SUBSTRING(str, start, end)

# Aggregation
LENGTH
ALL -- perform relational op over entire list (& all must satisfy)
ANY -- TRUE when matches only some               [^ gives FALSE]
CASE WHEN ... THEN ELSE END
```
## Some queries

```sql
select name, ROUND(gdp/(population*1000))*1000
WHERE name NOT LIKE '% %'

-- ughh
SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND((population / (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany')) * 100), '%') AS percentage
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe';

-- having mostly have aggregations as condition
-- WHERE applies to individual row
-- HAVING applies to entire group. Also both can appear in a query
select continent, count(distinct(name))
from world
where population > 10000000
Group by continent

-- ALL usage
select continent, name from world x
where 25000000 <= ALL (select population from world where continent = x.continent)
```
---

## Joins (+normalization)
```plsql
JOIN ON

SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as score1,
  team2,
  sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as score2
  FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON matchid = id
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2

-- grouping by mdata omitted some rows
-- ugggg submissions are from Â 9 years, 7 months ago ðŸ˜’
